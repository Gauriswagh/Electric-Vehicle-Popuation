 dataset from Kaggle using Python (Matplotlib, seaborn and plotly).

The project involves the following steps:
Download the  Electric Vehicle Population dataset from DATA.GOV and convert it into a pandas dataframe.
Perform data cleaning/deal with missing values using Pandas and NumPy.
Plot interactive graphs to understand the data using visual libraries like Plotly.
Ask and Answer interesting questions from the dataset.
